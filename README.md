# crisis-twitter-guidelines
A simple guide for getting heard during a disaster. [Contribute](https://github.com/betatim/crisis-twitter-guidelines/blob/master/README.md#ideas-contribute)

# Problem
When a natural disaster happens lots of aid arrives quickly but the helpers
lack local knowledge and information on where to go first. What they need are
local [Gandalfs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gandalf). This is especially true
in the first few hours or day of an emergency. People have tried
to use twitter and social media to get better information but often there
is too much noise and not enough signal.


# Solution
This project contains simple guidelines for social media users who are affected by a
crisis. The idea is to make their tweets easier to find and more actionable by following
three simple guidelines:

1. **Attach a picture** to your tweet - a picture says more than 1000 words
2. **Enable geotagging** - let people know where it is you are reporting from
3. Use the hashtag **#SOS** - to make it easy to find your tweet

In addition if you have the time it will be useful if you can:

* Stay on the line - try to stay online and answer questions
* Consider creating a new account to protect your privacy
